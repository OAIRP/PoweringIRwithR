    "text": "Extras\n\nKeeping R up-to-date\n\nUpdating R packages\nIn the terminal, run:\n\nupdate.packages()\n\nPackages with new updates will be detected and you will be prompted to respond Y or yes to accept.\nIf you want all packages updated without your confirmation, you can add the ask = FALSE argument:\n\nupdate.packages(ask = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou will see a warning when packages are built under a different version of R than you are running. If you see this, you likely want to update your version of R.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating R\nThe installr package can assist with keeping the R installation up-to-date. In the terminal, run the following:\n\ninstallr::updateR()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted as to whether you’d like to copy over all packages from the current version of R. This is a good idea!\n\n\n\n\n\nR Profile and Environment\nR will read certain options from special files that you can modify:\n\nR profile\nYour R profile can contain a range of settings to customize how you interact with R.\nThe usethis package can be used to edit your R profile:\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\nA new window will open with your R profile file that you can edit.\nFor example, you may want to set your default CRAN mirror to the one hosted at Case, since it is in Ohio and you may be as well. Add the following line to your R profile file:\n\noptions(repos=c(CRAN=\"https://cran.case.edu/\"))\n\nWhen done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.\n\n\nR environment\nThe R environment can store variables that you can call upon using special R functions. It is a great way to keep keys and other secrets out of your code but still accessible.\nThe usethis package can be used to easily edit your R environment:\n\nusethis::edit_r_envrion()\n\nTo store a variable named test_var, add the following to the file:\n\ntest_var:\"this is my test value\"\n\nWhen done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.\nYou’ll be able to access such variables like so:\n\nSys.getenv(\"test_var\")\n\n[1] \"this is my test value\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSome packages request that you store things like API keys as specified environment variables. You can also use this to store common URLs, including FTP sites, but keep in mind that they are accessible directly in the .Renviron file on your computer."

    "text": "The guide and workshop were developed by:\nThomas Jay Benjamin is the Director for Institutional Research at Lorain County Community College. Thomas began using R following a workshop at the Spring 2019 OAIRP conference and has used it to assist with IPEDS, benchmarking, evaluation, and parameterized reporting (which he presented at the Spring 2023 OAIRP virtual conference). Most recently Thomas hosted an intern from LCCC’s Data Analytics program who learned R during his experience.\nLynzee Murray serves as an analyst within the Office of Institutional Effectiveness at Columbus State Community College. Her introduction to R and RStudio occurred during her master’s program in Data Analytics at Bowling Green State University. During her tenure at Columbus State, Lynzee has utilized R for crafting data visualizations, conducting text analysis, and constructing comparison groups through propensity score matching.\nThomas and Lynzee can be contacted through the OAIRP Membership Portal."
