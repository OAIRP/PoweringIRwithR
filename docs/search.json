Go to https://r-project.org and follow the download link.\nThat will take you to the Comprehensive R Archive Network, or CRAN, which is “a network of servers that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.”\nThe closest CRAN mirror for Institutional Researchers working in Ohio is hosted by Case Western Reserve University. Its web address is https://cran.case.edu.\nChoose the distribution appropriate for your operating system under “Download and Install R,” then click on the link for “install R for the first time,” and then finally the larger “Download R…” link. Accept the licenses and the default settings."

We’ll learn more about tidyverse in Chapter 2.\nTo install the package, run the following command in the terminal:1\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNote that the package name must be in quotes (\"\") in the install.packages() command.\n\n\nWhen you first install an R package in a session, you will be prompted to choose a CRAN mirror, like you did when you first downloaded R:\n\nWe’ll choose USA (OH) [https], which is the mirror hosted in Ohio by Case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSee Section 1.6.4.1 for details on how to set your default CRAN repository.\n\n\nWe’ll install additional packages later.\nAccessing R in the basic R terminal is fairly limited, so we can close out of the program (or enter the q() command). R will ask you if you’d like to save the workspace image - just click “No”."

    "section": "1.4 Using an IDE",
    "text": "1.4 Using an IDE\nThe better way to work with R is to use an integrated development environment, or IDE. The IDE includes the R Terminal that will show the R output, but also additional helpful features like a file editor (to work with a script), a file browser, an image viewer (to view graph and other figure output), an R object viewer, R help text, and more.\n\nR Studio\nOne popular IDE for R is the open source edition of R Studio, developed by posit, a company that contributes greatly to various R packages and tools, including Quarto which we’ll use in Chapter 4. It can be downloaded at https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/.\nAfter you install and run for the first time, and let it detect the installation of R, your screen should look like this:\n\n\n\nOn the left is the R Console, with a tab for your OS Terminal. On the top right is the R environment, an R object viewer, with additional tabs for history, etc. On the bottom right is a file viewer, with additoinal tabs for plots, packages, help, and more.\n\n\n\n\nVisual Studio Code\nOne popular alternative to R Studio is Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code, or VS Code, is developed by Microsoft, and designed for a wide range of programming languages, supported by many extensions. Visual Studio Code’s source code is open source, but has additional Microsoft capabilities.2 Head to https://code.visualstudio.com to download Visual Studio Code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSince Visual Studio Code is designed to work with many languages, you’ll need to complete additional steps to configure VS Code for working with R. For this reason, it may be best to begin using R Studio and revisit VS Code at a later time. However, VS Code does include additonal features and better integration with Git and GitHub, which will be detailed in Chapter 5.\n\n\nYou’ll then need to install the R extension for Visual Studio Code which can be done using the Extensions module on the far left (or using Ctrl+Shift+X). You’ll also need to install the langugageserver package and want to install the httpgd package so that Visual Studio Code can display help text and plots, respectively. Refer back to Section 1.3 for details how to install packages.\nDepending on how you installed R, you may need to point Visual Studio Code to your R installation. Enter Settings (File &gt; Preferences &gt; Settings or Ctrl+,) then type or look for RTerm for your operating system. Point this to your instance of R (e.g. C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.3.1\\bin\\R.exe).\n\n\n\nOn the far left is a set of icons for the various modules, with the first selected for File Explorer and the R environment icon also visible. On the right is the Welcome window; this area will show file contents and view output when requested. On the bottom is a set of terminals, one of which is for R."

Go ahead and create a new folder in a location on your computer, such as Documents\\MyFirstRProject\\.\nDepending on your IDE, you’ll open your project by:\n\nIn R Studio, you’ll first click on “Project: (None)” in the upper right, then “New Project”, then “Existing Directory”, then point to the folder you created.\nIn VS Code, you’ll click “Open Folder” from the Welcome screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you end up with a lot of files, you can create folders within your project folder. This can help keep your project organized."

    "title": "1  Software setup and overview",
    "section": "1.6 Writing an R script",
    "text": "1.6 Writing an R script\nUp until now, we’ve entered commands directly into the R terminal. But much of the power of using R comes from writing many lines of code that work together.\nTo do this, we can create files that contain such code, as scripts.\nCreate a new .R file in your project folder. You can call it anything you’d like, such as script.R. By using the .R (or .r) extension, you’re indicating that the file is an R script.\nAt the top of the file we want to load any R packages that we’ll be using. We do this with the library() function. Let’s load tidyverse, then run our code (by clicking the Run button):\n\n\n\nscript.R\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.4.4     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\nNotice that the output shows the exact packages loaded as part of tidyverse. Not all packages have an output, but many do display some helpful information. The conflicts section notes that certain functionality from base R (stats) is masked by the packages loaded. This means when we run a function like filter(), by default it will now use the version from dplyr, which is part of tidyverse. We can always explicitly run a certain version by entering a function in the format package::function(), like stats::filter().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nNote that we never include an install.packages() command in our R script, only in the terminal. We don’t want to modify our computer using our script, and this is espeically important when we get to sharing code!\n\n\nNow we can add additional code to the script. Let’s create a new object my_fav_number and assign it the value of 2. Don’t worry, we’ll go over exactly what is happening here in Chapter 2.\n\n\n\nscript.R\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\nmy_fav_number &lt;- 2\n\n\nFinally, let’s add notes to ourselves so that we can remember what our code is doing. To do this, we use comments. In R, comments are denoted by the # symbol. When R encounters a # symbol, everything in the same line after that symbol is ignored when running the code. We always add a space between the # symbol and the text we’d like to use as a comment.\nWe can use comments at the end of a line of code to describe what is happening in that line, and we can write a comment as a whole line in the code to show what is happening in sections of code:\n\n\n\nscript.R\n\n# load libraries\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n\nmy_fav_number &lt;- 2  # 2 is my favorite number\n\n\nNow that we’ve written our first R script (!), we can run it. We can either run the entire script at once, or walk through the code line-by-line with Shift-Ctrl. Walking through code line-by-line can be a great way to develop code and test as you go.\nA few notes about keeping your code clean:\n\nUse blank lines to separate logically separate lines of code.\nUse spaces properly around characters and symbols.\nUse comments to keep your code comprehensible.\n\nWe’ll go over additional notes about writing clean code in the coming chapters."

If you see this, you likely want to update your version of R.\n\n\n\n\nUpdating R\nThe installr package can assist with keeping the R installation up-to-date. In the terminal, run the following:\n\ninstallr::updateR()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted as to whether you’d like to copy over all packages from the current version of R. This is a good idea!\n\n\n\n\nR Profile and Environment\nR will read certain options from special files that you can modify:\n\nR profile\nYour R profile can contain a range of settings to customize how you interact with R.\nThe usethis package can be used to edit your R profile:\n\nusethis::edit_r_profile()\n\nA new window will open with your R profile file that you can edit.\nFor example, you may want to set your default CRAN mirror to the one hosted at Case, since it is in Ohio and you may be as well. Add the following line to your R profile file:\n\noptions(repos=c(CRAN=\"https://cran.case.edu/\"))\n\nWhen done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.\n\n\nR environment\nThe R environment can store variables that you can call upon using special R functions. It is a great way to keep keys and other secrets out of your code but still accessible.\nThe usethis package can be used to easily edit your R environment:\n\nusethis::edit_r_envrion()\n\nTo store a variable named test_var, add the following to the file:\n\ntest_var:\"this is my test value\"\n\nWhen done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.\nYou’ll be able to access such variables like so:\n\nSys.getenv(\"test_var\")\n\n[1] \"this is my test value\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nSome packages request that you store things like API keys as specified environment variables. You can also use this to store common URLs, including FTP sites, but keep in mind that they are accessible directly in the .Renviron file on your computer."
