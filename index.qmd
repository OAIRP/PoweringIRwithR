# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online reference guide has been developed to accompany the [October 19, 2023 workshop at the Ohio Association for Institutional Research and Planning](https://oairp.org/event-5382943).

The workshop will follow a timeline aligned to the sections of this reference guide:

- @sec-introduction: Software setup and overview
- @sec-data: Importing and cleaning data
- @sec-analysis: Statistical analyses & data visualizations
- @sec-reports: Building parameterized reports
- @sec-collaboration: Collaborating on code

This reference guide is designed **for institutional researchers**, **by institutional researchers**, so it's chock full of examples relevant to IR and often compares R functions to what you might use in Microsoft Excel.
