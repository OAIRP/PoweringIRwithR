# Software setup and overview {#sec-introduction}

## Installation

First, we'll want to install the R software.  Go to <https://r-project.org> and follow the **download** link.

That will take you to the [**Comprehensive R Archive Network**](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), or CRAN, which is "a network of servers that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R."

The closest CRAN mirror for Institutional Researchers working in Ohio is hosted by Case Western Reserve University.  Its web address is <https://cran.case.edu>.

Choose the distribution appropriate for your operating system under "**Download and Install R**," then click on the link for "**install R for the first time**," and then finally the larger "**Download R...**" link.  Accept the licenses and the default settings.

## Using the R Terminal

You should now be able to find R listed among your installed programs.  Go ahead and run it.  You should see a screen like this:

![](screenshots/RGui.png){fig-alt="The R Guided User Interface (GUI)."}

The inner window is the **R Console**, also called the **R Terminal**, which is the R software interface:

![](screenshots/Rconsole.png){fig-alt="The R Console (also called the R Terminal)."}

Let's run our first command.  Since R is statistical software after all, let's use it as a calculator.  Enter `1 + 1` and press {{< kbd Enter >}}.  You should see the following:

```{R}
1 + 1
```

Congrats, you've run your first R command!

This way to access R is fairly limited, so we can close out of the program (or enter the `q()` command).  R will ask you if you'd like to save the workspace - just click "No".

## Using an IDE


## Installing R packages

While base R contains all kinds of helpful functions and tools, installing R packages provide additional functionality.

CRAN includes both the base R system and an array of approved R packages.

One such package that we'll be using is [`tidyverse`](tidyverse.org), a collection of R packages that make data analysis in R better.  We'll learn more about tidyverse in @sec-data.

To install the package, run the following command in the terminal:

```{R}
#| eval: false
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

::: {.callout-important}
Note that the package name must be in quotes (`""`) in the `install.packages()` command.
:::

When you first install an R package in a session, you will be prompted to choose a CRAN mirror, like you did when you first downloaded R:

![](screenshots/selectCRAN.png){#fig-CRANmirrors fig-alt="A listing of CRAN mirrors."}

We'll choose `USA (OH) [https]`, which is the mirror hosted in Ohio by Case.

::: {.callout-tip}
  See @sec-rprofile for details on how to set your default CRAN repository.
:::

We'll install additional packages later.

## Writing an R script

Up until now, we've entered commands directly into the R terminal.  But much of the power of using R comes from writing many lines of code that work together.

To do this, we can create files that contain such code, as **scripts**.

Create a new `.R` file in your project folder.  You can call it anything you'd like, such as `script.R`.  By using the `.R` (or `.r`) extension, you're indicating that the file is an R script.

At the top of the file we want to load any R packages that we'll be using.  We do this with the `library()` function.  Let's load `tidyverse`, then run our code:

```{R filename="script.R"}
library("tidyverse")
```

Notice that the output shows the exact packages loaded as part of `tidyverse`.  Not all packages have an output, but many do display some helpful information.  The conflicts section notes that certain functionality from base R (`stats`) is masked by the packages loaded.  This means when we run a function like `filter()`, by default it will now use the version from `dplyr`, which is part of `tidyverse`.  We can always explicitly run a certain version by entering a function in the format `package::function()`, like `stats::filter()`.

::: {.callout-warning}
Note that we never include an `install.packages()` command in our R script, only in the terminal.  We don't want to modify our computer using our script, and this is espeically important when we get to sharing code!
:::

Now we can add additional code to the script.  Let's create a new object `my_fav_number` and assign it the value of `2`.  Don't worry, we'll go over exactly what is happening here in @sec-data.

```{R filename="script.R"}
#| eval: false
library("tidyverse")

my_fav_number <- 2
```

Finally, let's add notes to ourselves so that we can remember what our code is doing.  To do this, we use **comments**.  In R, comments are denoted by the `#` symbol.  When R encounters a `#` symbol, everything in the same line after that symbol is ignored when running the code.  We always add a space between the `#` symbol and the text we'd like to use as a comment.

We can use comments at the end of a line of code to describe what is happening in that line, and we can write a comment as a whole line in the code to show what is happening in sections of code:

```{R filename="script.R"}
#| eval: false
# load libraries
library("tidyverse")

my_fav_number <- 2  # 2 is my favorite number
```

Now that we've written our first R script **(!)**, we can run it.  We can either run the entire script at once, or walk through the code line-by-line with {{< kbd Shift-Ctrl >}}.  Walking through code line-by-line can be a great way to develop code and test as you go.

A few notes about keeping your code clean:

* Use **blank lines** to separate logically separate lines of code.
* Use **spaces** properly around characters and symbols.
* Use **comments** to keep your code comprehensible.

We'll go over additional notes about writing clean code in the coming chapters.


## Exersices {.unnumbered}

### Exercise 1

In @sec-data we'll use the package `readxl` to read in data from Excel files, since IR professionals often encounter data we need to work with in Excel files!  How would you install the `readxl` package?

```{R}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
install.packages("readxl")
```


### Exercise 2

Start a new R script that loads the `readxl` package.  Include a comment to remind you of what is happening.

```{R}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
# load libraries
library("readxl") # to read data from Excel files
```


## Extra: Keeping R up-to-date {.unnumbered}

### Updating R packages

In the terminal, run:

```{R}
#| eval: false
update.packages()
```

Packages with new updates will be detected and you will be prompted to respond `Y` or `yes` to accept.

If you want all packages updated without your confirmation, you can add the `ask = FALSE` argument:

```{R}
#| eval: false
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
You will see a warning when packages are built under a different version of R than you are running.  If you see this, you likely want to update your version of R.
:::

### Updating R

The `installr` package can assist with keeping the R installation up-to-date.  In the terminal, run the following:

```{R}
#| eval: false
installr::updateR()
```

::: {.callout-tip}
You will be prompted as to whether you'd like to copy over all packages from the current version of R.  This is a good idea!
:::

### R Profile and Environment {.unnumbered}

R will read certain options from special files that you can modify:

#### R profile {#sec-rprofile}

Your R *profile* can contain a range of settings to customize how you interact with R.

The `usethis` package can be used to edit your R profile:

```{R}
#| eval: false
usethis::edit_r_profile()
```

A new window will open with your R profile file that you can edit.

For example, you may want to set your default CRAN mirror to the one hosted at Case, since it is in Ohio and you may be as well.  Add the following line to your R profile file:

```{R}
#| eval: false
options(repos=c(CRAN="https://cran.case.edu/"))
```

When done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.


#### R environment

The R *environment* can store variables that you can call upon using special R functions.  It is a great way to keep keys and other secrets out of your code but still accessible.

The `usethis` package can be used to easily edit your R environment:

```{R}
#| eval: false
usethis::edit_r_envrion()
```

To store a variable named `test_var`, add the following to the file:

```{R}
#| eval: false
test_var:"this is my test value"
```

When done, save the file, then close all R terminals and reopen them.

You'll be able to access such variables like so:

```{R}
Sys.getenv("test_var")
```

::: {.callout-warning}
Some packages request that you store things like API keys as specified environment variables.  You can also use this to store common URLs, including FTP sites, but keep in mind that they are accessible directly in the `.Renviron` file on your computer.
